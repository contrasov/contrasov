## 🚀 Sobre mim
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://media.tenor.com/NTcLs_Su1c8AAAAd/arthur-morgan-rdr2.gif" />


Aoba, my name is Álvaro, and since I was little, I've always wanted to understand how a computer works. I've been asking people who made me fall in love with the IT field. Nowadays, studying Software Engineering at UFC, I've discovered my passion for programming. Today, I'm here, eager to dive into this area and set up my amazing workstation.


## Other little things...
👩‍💻 I'm not currently employed...

🧠 I'm learning web development.

👯‍♀️ I aim to continuously expand my mind.
